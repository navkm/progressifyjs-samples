        <h2>The Day the Earth Smiled</h2>
        <p>
            On July 19, 2013, in an event celebrated the world over, NASA's Cassini spacecraft slipped into Saturn's 
            shadow and turned to image the planet, seven of its moons, its inner rings -- and, in the background, 
            our home planet, Earth.
        </p>   
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/The_Day_the_Earth_Smiled_-_PIA17172.jpg" width="300px"/>
        <p>   
        With the sun's powerful and potentially damaging rays eclipsed by Saturn itself, Cassini's onboard cameras
        were able to take advantage of this unique viewing geometry. They acquired a panoramic mosaic of the Saturn 
        system that allows scientists to see details in the rings and throughout the system as they are backlit by the
        sun. This mosaic is special as it marks the third time our home planet was imaged from the outer solar system; 
        the second time it was imaged by Cassini from Saturn's orbit; and the first time ever that inhabitants of Earth
         were made aware in advance that their photo would be taken from such a great distance.
       </p>
       <p>
        With both Cassini's wide-angle and narrow-angle cameras aimed at Saturn, Cassini was able to capture 323 images 
        in just over four hours. This final mosaic uses 141 of those wide-angle images. Images taken using the red, green
         and blue spectral filters of the wide-angle camera were combined and mosaicked together to create this natural-color 
         view. A brightened version with contrast and color enhanced (Figure 1), a version with just the planets annotated 
         (Figure 2), and an annotated version (Figure 3) are shown above.This image spans about 404,880 miles (651,591 kilometers) across.
       </p>    
    
        <p> 
        The outermost ring shown here is Saturn's E ring, the core of which is situated about 149,000 miles (240,000 kilometers)
         from Saturn. The geysers erupting from the south polar terrain of the moon Enceladus supply the fine icy particles 
         that comprise the E ring; diffraction by sunlight gives the ring its blue color. Enceladus (313 miles, or 
         504 kilometers, across) and the extended plume formed by its jets are visible, embedded in the E ring on the left 
         side of the mosaic.
